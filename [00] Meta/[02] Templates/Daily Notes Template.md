> [!info] Guidelines
> - To avoid headaches, listen to white noise instead of music when you need to block out sound or focus.
> - Open tasks will be tracked globally. Tasks should open with a brief. `<subject> - <statement>`
> - Log temporary ideas in daily notes to pick up where you left off. The source of truth for any topic belongs in a permanent note.
